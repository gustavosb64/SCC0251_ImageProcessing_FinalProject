# SCC0251_ImageProcessing_FinalProject
Final project for the course SCC0251 Image Processing offered by Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Computation from University of SÃ£o Paulo in 2022.

## Project: Extracting rivers from satellite images
This project aims to test image processing methods, such as tresholding, mathematical morphology and Canny edges detection, to extract rivers' shapes from satellite images. We aim to compare our results among different rivers captures, working with different colour channels and other image treating methods according to each specific case in order to find whether there are a most advantageous algorithm or method for extraction for each one.
We plan to use images avaiable for public access by INPE (www.dg.inpe.br) as input.
